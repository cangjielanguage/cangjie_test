  @Assertion: 6.1.2.3(4)
              In this case, the execution sequence of the variable initialization
              is before the call of the super classâ€™s constructor,
              it is prohibited to use qualified names with super
              to access the member variables of the superclass
              in the initial value expression of the instance member variables.

  @Description: Check that a mutable protected instance member variable can not use as an initial value
                an immutable public instance variable of the superclass
