  @Name: 06_01_02_01_a60_07

  @Level:         1

  @Assertion: 6.1.2.1(60)
              The compiler analyzes the dependency between all constructors.
              If a cyclic invoking is performed, an error is reported.

  @Description: Check that two constructors calling eache other through another instance
                causes an error

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single

  @Issue: 0006228

  @Comment: The assertion is a part of the list of rules of using constructors, this and super.
            It says the compiler analyzes dependencies between 'all' constructors.
            But the intention here might be 'all constructors called on the same instance', i.e through 'this'.
            So depending on the resolution of issue 6228 these tests might be removed.
