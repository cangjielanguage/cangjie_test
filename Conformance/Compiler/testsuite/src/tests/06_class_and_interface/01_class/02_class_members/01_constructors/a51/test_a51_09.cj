  @Level:         1

  @Assertion: 6.1.2.1(51)
              If called, it must be at the first expression in the constructor body,
              without any expression or declaration before it.

  @Description: Check that super can not be called at the end of the constructor

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single

  @Comment: This is the continuation of the previous assertion:
            "Init constructors in the class can call other constructors (via this call expression)
            in the class or superclassâ€˜s constructor(via super call expression),
            but only one of them can be called.
