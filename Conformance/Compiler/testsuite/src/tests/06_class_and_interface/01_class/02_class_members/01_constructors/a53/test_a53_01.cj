  @Name: 06_01_02_01_a53_01

  @Level:         1

  @Assertion: 6.1.2.1(53)
              If the super class does not have a parameterless constructor,
              an error will be reported during compilation.

  @Description: Check that an error is produced if
                the superclass does not have a parameterless constructor
                and the subclass's constructor does not call any constructors explicitly

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single

  @Comment: This is the continuation of the previous assertion:
            "If the constructor does not explicitly calling other constructors
            or calling the superclassâ€™s constructor, the compiler inserts
            the parameterless constructor of the super class into the constructor."
            So it only applies to implicit constructors
