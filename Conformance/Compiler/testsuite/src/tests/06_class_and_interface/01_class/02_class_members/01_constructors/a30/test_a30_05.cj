  @Assertion: 6.1.2.1(30)
              A primary constructor is a syntax sugar of regular constructor.
              The compiler automatically generates a definition of the constructor
              and member variables corresponding to the main constructor,
              the form of the automatically generated constructor is as follows:
              • The modifier is the same as that of the primary constructor.
              • The sequence of parameters from left to right is the same as that of parameters
                declared in the primary constructor parameter list.
              • The constructor body is in the following format:
                – Assign values to member variables in sequence.
                  The syntax format is this.x = x, where x indicates the member variable name.
                – The code in the primary constructor body.

  @Description: Check that the constructor generated from a private primary constructor
                is visible inside the class

  @Mode: run

  @Negative: no

  @Structure: single
