  @Level:         1

  @Assertion:    1.3(2) Literals also have types. The types that have literals in Cangjie
                 include: integer types, floating point types, character type, boolean type
                 and string type.

  @Description:  Checks that:
                 - literal, defined with IntegerLiteralSuffix for type Int16, has expected integer value.
                 - immutable variable, assigned by literal with IntegerLiteralSuffix for type Int16,
                   has expected integer value.
                 - mutable variable, assigned by literal with IntegerLiteralSuffix for type Int16,
                   has expected integer value.

  @Mode:         run

  @Negative:     no

  @Structure:    single
