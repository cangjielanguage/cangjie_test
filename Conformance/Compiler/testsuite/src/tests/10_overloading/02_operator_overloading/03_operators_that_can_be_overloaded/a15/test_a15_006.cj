  @Assertion:   10.2.3(15) 2. Once the two binary operators other than the relational operators <, <=, >, >=, == and
                !=) are overloaded on a certain type, and the return type of the operator function is the same as or a
                subtype of the type of the left operator, then the corresponding compound assignment symbol can be
                naturally used on this type. However, if the type of the return value of the operator function is not
                the same as nor the subtype of the type of the left operand, a type mismatch error is generated when
                using the corresponding compound assignment symbol on this type.
  @Description: Checks that if overloaded operator op for type IntNative with argument type T
                has return type IntNative, which is a subtype of IntNative,
                then compound assignment operator op= can be used with types IntNative and T.
