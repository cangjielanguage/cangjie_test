  @Assertion:   10.2.3(18)  5. For a type T, if T already supports some of the above operators that can be overloaded
                by default, then implementing the operator function with the same signature for T by extension will
                result in a redefinition error. For example, a redefinition error is reported when overloading a
                supported operator with the same signature such as an arithmetic operator, bitwise operator or
                relational operator for a numeric type, or overloading a relational operator with the same signature
                for the Rune type, or overloading a same signatured logical, equal or unequal operator for the Bool
                type, etc. 
  @Description: Checks that operator | cannot be overloaded for types UInt8 and UInt8.
  @Mode: compileonly
  @Negative: yes
  @Structure: single
