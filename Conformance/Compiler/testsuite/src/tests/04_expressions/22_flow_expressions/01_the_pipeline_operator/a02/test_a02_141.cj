  @Assertion:   4.22.1(2) Here, e2 is the expression of the function type. The type of e1 matches the parameter type of
                e2. Or the type of e2 implements the operator () overloading, (see Operators that can be Overloaded),
                i.e. e1 |> e2 is the syntactic sugar of let v = e1; e2(v) and e2(v) is the function call overloading.
                See section 4.13.2 for details.
  @Description: Checks that using operator |> with types Float32 and (Bool) -> (Int8, Int8) is not permitted.
  @Mode: compileonly
  @Negative: yes
  @Structure: single
