  @Assertion:   4.15(62) Arithmetic operators introduced above are safe in the Cangjie programming language. That is,
                if an overflow (i.e., the value of an expression is beyond the range of its type) is detected at
                compile time, then a compilation error will be reported; otherwise an ArithmeticException is thrown
                at runtime.
  @Description: Checks for Int16 a, b that compilation fails because of the overflow of a * b (lower bound).
  @Mode: compileonly
  @Negative: yes
  @Structure: single
  @CompileWarning: no
  @Comment: Auto-generated by gen_compile_error.py
