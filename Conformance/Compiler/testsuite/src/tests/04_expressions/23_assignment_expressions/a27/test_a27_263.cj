  @Name:        04_23_a27_263

  @Level:         1

  @Assertion:   4.23(27) 3. The return type of the overloaded operator needs to be the same as or a subtype of the left
                operand, i.e., as for a, b, op in the expression a op=b, they need to pass the type check of
                a = a op b.
  @Description: Checks that if overloaded operator / for type K with argument type T has 
                return type L, then compound assignment operator /= cannot be
                used with types K and T.
