  @Level:         1

  @Assertion:   4.23(27) 3. The return type of the overloaded operator needs to be the same as or a subtype of the left
                operand, i.e., as for a, b, op in the expression a op=b, they need to pass the type check of
                a = a op b.
  @Description: Checks that if overloaded operator op for type C with argument type T
                has return type C, which is a subtype of C,
                then compound assignment operator op= can be used with types C and T.
