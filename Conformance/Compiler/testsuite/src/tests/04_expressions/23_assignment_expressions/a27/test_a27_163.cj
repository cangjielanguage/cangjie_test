  @Level:         1

  @Assertion:   4.23(27) 3. The return type of the overloaded operator needs to be the same as or a subtype of the left
                operand, i.e., as for a, b, op in the expression a op=b, they need to pass the type check of
                a = a op b.
  @Description: Checks that if overloaded operator << for type UInt64 with argument type T has 
                return type Unit, then compound assignment operator <<= cannot be
                used with types UInt64 and T.
