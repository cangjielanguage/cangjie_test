  @Assertion:   4.23(17) This design helps to avoid mistakes where an assignment expression is mistakenly used as an
                equal expression. For instance, given the expression a = b = 0, the expression (a = b) is firstly
                evaluated and the value is (). Next, the expression () = 0 is evaluated. Since () cannot be an assigned
                to, an error is reported.
  @Description: Checks that expression a = b = 0 is invalid for type UIntNative.
  @Mode: compileonly
  @Negative: yes
  @Structure: single
  @CompileWarning: ignore
