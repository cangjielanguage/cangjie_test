  @Assertion:   4.23(18) Similarly, if an assignment expression is mistakenly used in the conditional expression,
                because the conditional expression is expected to have a value of type Bool whereas the assignment
                values in (), an error is generated.
  @Description: Checks that the expression if (a &= b) is invalid for type Int8.
