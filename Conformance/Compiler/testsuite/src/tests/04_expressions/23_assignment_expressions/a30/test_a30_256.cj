  @Assertion:   4.23(30) Multi-assignment expressions are a special kind of assignment expressions. The left side of
                the equals sign of a multi-assignment expression must be a tuple, the elements inside this tuple must
                be left-valued, the expression on the right side of the equals sign must also be of tuple type, and the
                type of each element of the right tuple must be a subtype of the left-valued type of the corresponding
                position.
  @Description: Checks that multi-assignment is not permitted when some element of type (B, B) -> (B, B)
                in the right tuple is matched with an element of type (A, B) -> (A, C) in the left tuple.
