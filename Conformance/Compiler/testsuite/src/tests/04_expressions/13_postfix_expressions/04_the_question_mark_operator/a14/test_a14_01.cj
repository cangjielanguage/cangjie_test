  @Assertion: 4.13.4(14) Letâ€™s look at another example containing multiple ? for a multi-layer access a?.b.c?.d
              (just take ?.
              as an example, other operators are similar and will not be repeated), it can be found that:

              2. The expression a?.b.c?.d is of type Option<Td>, where Td is the type of the instance member d of Tc.

  @Description: Check that expression 'a?.b.c?.d' type is 'Option<Td>'.

  @Mode: run

  @Negative: no
