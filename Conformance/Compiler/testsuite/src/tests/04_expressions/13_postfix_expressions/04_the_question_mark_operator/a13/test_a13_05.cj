  @Assertion: 4.13.4(13) Letâ€™s look at another example containing multiple ? for a multi-layer access a?.b.c?.d
              (just take ?.
              as an example, other operators are similar and will not be repeated), it can be found that:

              1. The type of the expression a needs to be some Option<Ta> and Ta contains the instance member b. The
                 type of b contains the instance member variable c and the type of c is some Option<Tc> and Tc
                 contains the instance member d.

  @Description: Check that if 'Tc' in 'a?.b.c?.d' example expression does not have an instance member 'd', compiler
                will emit an error.

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes
