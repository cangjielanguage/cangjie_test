  @Assertion: 4.13.4(15) Letâ€™s look at another example containing multiple ? for a multi-layer access a?.b.c?.d
              (just take ?.
              as an example, other operators are similar and will not be repeated), it can be found that:

              3. When the value of a is equal to Some(va) and the value of va.b.c is equal to Some(vc), the value of
                 a?.b.c?.d is equal to Option<Td>.Some(vc.d). When the value of a is equal to Some(va) and the value
                 of va.b.c is equal to None, the value of a?.b.c? d is equal to Option<Td>.None (d will not be
                 evaluated). When the value of a is equal to None, the value of a?.b.c?.d is equal to Option<Td>.None
                 (neither b, c nor d will be evaluated).

  @Description: Check that value of 'a?.b.c?.d' is equal to 'Option<Td>.None' when the value of 'a' is equal to 'None'.
                Also checks that neither b, c or d will be evaluated.

  @Mode: run

  @Negative: no

// NOTE: There is no way to check that instance member access will not be evaluated, because instance member access
//       does not have side effects. Check the claim through usage of instance member which is less strict.
