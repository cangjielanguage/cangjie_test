  @Assertion: 4.4(24) Similar to if expressions, the types of match expressions follow the following rules regardless
              whether they have selectors or not: When match expression is not read or returned, then the type of the
              match expression is Unit, and the branchesâ€™ types are not required to have common supertype;
  @Description: Checks that the reading of the match expression whose branches does not have common supertype causes a
                compile error.
  @Mode: compileonly
  @Negative: yes
  @Structure: single
  @CompileWarning: no
