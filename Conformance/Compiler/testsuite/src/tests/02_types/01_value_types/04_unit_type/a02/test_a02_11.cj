   @Assertion:    2.1.4(2) Except the = operator (an expression with Unit type can be assigned 
                  to a variable with Unit type), the equal (==) operator and the not equal (!=) operator, 
                  there are no other operators defined for Unit. Therefore, any operation 
                  (other than the above three operations) that is performed on Unit type is invalid.

   @Description:  Check that operator ** is not defined for Unit

   @Mode:         compileonly

   @Negative:     yes

   @Structure:    single
