  @Assertion:   2.1.1(4) Unsigned integer types include UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64 and
                UIntNative, which are types of unsigned integer values encoded with 8-bit,
                16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit and platform dependent size, respectively.

  @Description: Checks that variable declared with unsigned integer type UIntNative actually 
                has type UIntNative and can be assigned by positive value and zero;

  @Mode:        run

  @Negative:    no

  @Structure:   single
