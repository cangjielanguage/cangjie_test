  @Assertion:       2.1.1.2(6) Explicit type conversion must be performed first to perform operations on operands with
                    different types.

  @Description:     Check that it isn't possible to use * with operands of different types (IntNative and Int64).

  @Mode:            compileonly
  @Negative:        yes
  @Structure:       single
  @CompileWarning:  no

  @Comment:         ** isn't checked because the power operator only allows different types (Int64 and UInt64). See
                    comment on issue 6166.
  @Issue:           0006166
