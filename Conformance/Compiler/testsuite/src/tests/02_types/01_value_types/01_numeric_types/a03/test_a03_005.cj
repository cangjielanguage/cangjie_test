  @Assertion:   2.1.1(3) Signed integer types include Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64 and IntNative,
                which are used to represent types of signed integer values whose lengths are
                8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit and platform dependent size, respectively.

  @Description: Checks that:
                - variable declared with signed integer type IntNative actually has type IntNative
                  and can be assigned by positive, negative integer values and zero;

  @Mode:        run

  @Negative:    no

  @Structure:   single
