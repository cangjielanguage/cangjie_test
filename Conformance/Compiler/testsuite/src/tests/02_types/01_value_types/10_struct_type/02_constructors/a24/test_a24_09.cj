  @Level:         1

  @Assertion: 2.1.10.2(24)
              Declarations and expressions are allowed in the primary constructor body
              but must meet the requirements of init constructors.

  @Description: Check that an immutable instance property can not be accessed through 'this' inside 
                the primary constructor before all the instance variables are initialized

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single

  @Issue: 0006194, 0006124

  @Comment: From the description in the init constructor section:
            Before all of the instance member variables are initialized,
            the constructor cannot use functions or lambda that capture this
