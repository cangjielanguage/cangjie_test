              A struct can have multiple constructors
              (including the constructor generated by the primary constructor),
              but they should to meet the requirements of function overloading
              (see Function Overloading Definition for details).

  @Description: Check that an overloading conflict can be caused by generic instantiation

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes
