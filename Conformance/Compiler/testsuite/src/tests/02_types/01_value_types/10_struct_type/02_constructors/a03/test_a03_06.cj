  @Comment: This assertion is a part of the list with the following heading:
            A primary constructor definition includes the following:

  @Assertion: 2.1.10.2(3)
              Modifier: optional. Primary constructors can be modified with one of
              public or private, none of which are visible within the package.
              See Access Modifiers for details

  @Description: Check that a struct with a private constructor can not be instantiated from another package

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: complex-main

  @Dependencies: a03_06_aux.cj

  @Comment: There is no description on what modifiers do for primary constructors.
            This behavior is inferred from the fact that the compiler converts primary constructors into
            init constructors and the description of modifiers for init constructors

  @Issue: 0006179
