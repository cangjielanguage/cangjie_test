  @Assertion: 2.1.10.2(29)
              In addition to the primary constructor,
              other constructors can be defined as usual,
              but the other constructors must form an overload
              with the corresponding constructor of the primary constructor.

  @Description: Check that a struct can not have a primary constructor
                and an init constructor with the same signature
                and with different modifiers:
                one signature has a named parameter and another has an unnamed parameter

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single
