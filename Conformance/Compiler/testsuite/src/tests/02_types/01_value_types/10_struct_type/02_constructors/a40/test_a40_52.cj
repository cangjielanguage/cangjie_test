              If a constructor does not explicitly call other constructors,
              ensure that all instance member variables declared in this struct
              have been initialized before returned from the constructor.
              Otherwise, an error will be reported during compilation.

  @Description: Check that an error is produced if a struct has two constructors
                and only the private constructor does not initialize an immutable instance variable

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes
