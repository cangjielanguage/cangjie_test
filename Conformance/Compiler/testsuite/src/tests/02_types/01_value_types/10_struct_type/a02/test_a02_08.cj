  @Assertion:   2.1.10(2) The following grammar shows the definition of struct types:
                 structDefinition
                  : structModifier? 'struct' identifier typeParameters? ('<:' superInterfaces)? 
                    genericConstraints? structBody
                  ;
  
                 structBody
                  : '{'
                   structMemberDeclaration*
                   structPrimaryInit?
                   structMemberDeclaration*
                  '}'
                  ;
  
                 structMemberDeclaration
                  : structInit
                  | staticInit
                  | variableDeclaration
                  | functionDefinition
                  | operatorFunctionDefinition
                  | macroExpression
                  | propertyDefinition
                  ;

                In above, structModifier indicates the modifier of struct, and struct is the keyword, 
                and identifier is the name of the struct type. 
                typeParameters and genericConstraints are list of type variables 
                and their constraints (refer to chapter 9 for generics), respectively.

  @Description: Checks that struct definition causes compilation error when 
                 structPrimaryInit is being declared with unsutable modifier.

  @Mode:        compileOnly
  @Negative:    no
  @Structure:   single
