  @Assertion:       2.1.10.4(4) Member variables defined within primary constructor can only be modified with
                    visibility modifiers (i.e. public or private, leaving it out is Default), not with the static
                    modifier.

  @Description:     Check that "override" can't be a modifier of a member variable defined within primary constructor.

  @Mode:            compileonly
  @Negative:        yes
  @Structure:       single
  @CompileWarning:  no
