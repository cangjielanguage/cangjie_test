  @Assertion:       2.1.10.5(5) Using StructName<Type1, Type2, ..., TypeK>(labelValue1, labelValue2, ..., labelValueN)
                    for defining instances of generic structs. The only difference from defining an instance of a
                    non-generic struct is that type variables need to be instanced for generic struct, i.e., `Type1` to
                    `TypeN` should be given.

  @Description:     Check that it isn't possible to create a generic struct instance using fewer type variables than
                    required.

  @Mode:            compileonly
  @Negative:        yes
  @Structure:       single
  @CompileWarning:  no
