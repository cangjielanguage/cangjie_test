              If a constructor does not explicitly call other constructors,
              ensure that all instance member variables declared in this struct
              have been initialized before returned from the constructor.
              Otherwise, an error will be reported during compilation.

  @Description: Check that an error is produced if a struct has a single private constructor
                that does not initialize a private mutable instance variable

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes
