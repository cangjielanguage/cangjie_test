  @Name: 02_01_10_02_a34_30

  @Level:         1

  @Assertion: 2.1.10.2(34)
              Before all of the instance member variables are initialized,
              the constructor cannot use functions or lambda that capture this,
              but can use this.variableName (the syntax sugar variableName) to access initialized member variables.

  @Description: Check that a private instance member function
                can not be used as an expression
                before all member variables are initialized

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes

  @Structure: single
