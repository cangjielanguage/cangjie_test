              In addition to the primary constructor, it is possible to define user-defined constructors,
              which are defined by starting with the keyword init and followed
              by the parameter list and the function body.

  @Description: Check that a constructor can not be defined with the 'break' keyword

  @Mode: compileonly

  @Negative: yes
