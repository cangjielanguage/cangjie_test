  @Level:         1

  @Assertion:       2.1.11.2(6) When it is not possible to resolve, both the enum constructor and the function 
  cannot be used directly, so the enum constructor needs to be used by type prefixing 
  and the function needs to be used by prefix qualification.


  @Description:     Checks that conflicting struct and enum constructor 
  produce compilation error

  @Mode:            compileonly
  @Negative:        no
  @Structure:       single
  @Issue:           6508
