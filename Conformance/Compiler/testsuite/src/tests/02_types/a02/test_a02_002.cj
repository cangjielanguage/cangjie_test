  @Assertion:    2(2) At the same time, it is a strongly typed language, 
                 i.e. every expression is associated with a type and the type of 
                 expression not only decides its possible values, but also decides that 
                 can be performed on them.

  @Description:  Checks that attempt to assign a expression, calculating a value of type UInt64,
                 to a variable of type UInt16 results in a compilation error.

  @Mode:         compileonly

  @Negative:     yes

  @Structure:    single
