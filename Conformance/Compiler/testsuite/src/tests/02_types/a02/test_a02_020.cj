  @Assertion:    2(2) At the same time, it is a strongly typed language, 
                 i.e. every expression is associated with a type and the type of 
                 expression not only decides its possible values, but also decides that 
                 can be performed on them.

  @Description:  Checks that attempt to use in expression of type Int8 the value less than
                 minimal value of Int8 (-128) results in a compilation error.

  @Mode:         compileonly

  @Negative:     yes
