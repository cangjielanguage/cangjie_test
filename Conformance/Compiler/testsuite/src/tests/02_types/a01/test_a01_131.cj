  @Assertion:   2(1) The Cangjie Programming Language is a statically typed language, 
                i.e. type checking for ensuring safety is mostly performed at compile time.

  @Description:  Checks that attempt to assign a variable of type 'struct' to a variable of type Float32 
                 results in a compilation error.

  @Mode:         compileonly

  @Negative:     yes

  @Structure:    single
