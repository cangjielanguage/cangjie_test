  @Name:         02_02_01_a07_02

  @Level:         1
  @Assertion:    2.2.1(7) Only when the concrete type Type in Array<T> supports
                 using ==(! =) for equality (inequality) comparison, Array<T>
                 supports == and ! =, otherwise, Array<T> does not support ==
                 and ! = (a compilation error will be generated when using ==
                 and ! = for comparison).
                 We say two instances of Array<T> (with the same type) are
                 equal, if and only if elements in the same position (i.e.,
                 index) are all equal, which means they have the same length.

  @Description:  Checks that equality works as expected for Arrays of types
                 supporting == and != operations

  @Mode:         run
  @Negative:     no
  @Structure:    single
