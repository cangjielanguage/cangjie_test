  @Assertion:    2.2.1.2(1) For an array instance arr, manners for accessing
                 elements in arr is showed as follows: Accessing an element at
                 a specific location: Element at a specific location can be
                 accessed through arr[index1]...[indexN]
                 (where index1,...,indexN is an expression for the index value,
                 whose types are all Int64).

  @Description:  Checks that array elements can't be accessed outside array
                 bounds
