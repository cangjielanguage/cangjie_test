  @Assertion:    2.3.1(4) The conversion of Rune to UInt32 uses UInt32(e), where e is an expression of type Rune
                 and the result of UInt32(e) is the UInt32 value corresponding to the Unicode scalar value of e.

  @Description:  Check that conversion of non-unicode literal character to Uint32 causes a compilation error

  @Mode:         run

  @Negative:     no

  @CompileWarning: yes
