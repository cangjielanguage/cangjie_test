  @Level:         1
  @Assertion:    15.3.5(5) â€¢ The thread automatically releases the mutex m when
                 it leaves a synchronized(m) code block. Only one unlock
                 operation is performed, so nested blocks synchronized on the
                 same mutex are allowed.

  @Description:  Checks that mutex can be re-used after exit from synchronized
                 section

  @Mode:         run
  @Negative:     no
  @Structure:    complex-main
  @Dependencies: ../aux_sync_lock_unlock.cj
