  @Level:         1
  @Assertion:    15.1(11) In the process of executing the spawn expression, the
                 closure will be encapsulated into a runtime task and submitted
                 to the scheduler. The schedulerâ€™s strategy determines when to
                 execute the task. Once the spawn expression is executed, the
                 corresponding thread is ready to execute.

  @Description:  Checks that spawn expression is executed

  @Mode:         run
  @Negative:     no
  @Structure:    single

  @Issue:        0006098
