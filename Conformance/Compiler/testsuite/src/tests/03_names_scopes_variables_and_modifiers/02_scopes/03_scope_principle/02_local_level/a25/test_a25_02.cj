  @Assertion:    3.2.3.2(25) For while and do-while expressions, neither of their loop conditions 
                             can refer to the variable names introduced in their loop bodies,
                             even if the loop condition for do-while comes later then the loop body.

  @Description:  Checks that the loop condition for the do-while expression cannot refer to the variable 
                 introduced in the loop body.
