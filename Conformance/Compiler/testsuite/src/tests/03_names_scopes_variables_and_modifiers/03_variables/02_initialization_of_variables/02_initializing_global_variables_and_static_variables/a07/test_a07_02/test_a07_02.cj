  @Assertion:    3.3.2.2(7) Note that the initialization order between files/packages doesnâ€™t form a
                 total order. If there are no dependency between files/packages, or circular dependency
                 between files/packages, then the initialization order between the files/packages is
                 non-deterministic and depends on implementation.

  @Description:  File5 depends on File2 & File4
                 File4 depends on File1 & File3
                 File2 depends on File1 & File4
                 File1 depends on File3
                 Dependencies with functions
                 Initialization order: File3, File1, File4, File2, File5

  @Mode:         run

  @Negative:     no
