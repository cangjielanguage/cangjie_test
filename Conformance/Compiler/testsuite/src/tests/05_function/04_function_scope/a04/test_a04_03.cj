  @Assertion:       5.4(4) â€¢ Nested functions 
                    A function declared in a function body is a nested function. Its scope is local, for details, see 
                    Scopes. i.e., it is accessible only with the function body.                          

  @Description:     Check that nested function can't be accesed outside parent function: from another global function
                    defined before parent.

  @Mode:            compileonly

  @Negative:        yes

  @Structure:       single
