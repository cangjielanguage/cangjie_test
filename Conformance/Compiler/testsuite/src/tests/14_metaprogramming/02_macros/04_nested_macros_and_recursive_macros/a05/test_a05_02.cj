  @Assertion:    14.2.4(5) For situations where itâ€™s important that an inner macro call finds itself nested inside a
                 particular outer macro call, the inner macro can call the library function assertParentContext, 
                 which will throw an error unless the inner macro call is nested in the given outer macro call. 
 
  @Description:  Check that the assertParentContext function will throw an error

  @Negative:     yes

  @Structure:    complex-main
