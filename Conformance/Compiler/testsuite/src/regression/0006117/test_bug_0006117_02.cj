  @Name:            bug_0006117_02
  @Assertion:       Calling interface func with super modifier results in a compilation error

  @Description:     A parent interface function can be called without the super modifier, but not with the super
                    modifier.

  @Mode:            compileonly
  @Negative:        yes
  @Structure:       single
  @CompileWarning:  no

  @Comment:         Not a Bug, so the test has been changed from positive to negative.
